# To-Do-List
This Python program provides a simple To-Do List application using the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface (GUI). Users can add tasks, delete selected tasks, and save or load them from a file.

The interface includes a listbox to display tasks, an entry field to input new tasks, and buttons for adding, deleting, saving, and loading tasks. Tasks are saved to a file (`tasks.dat`) using the `pickle` module, and users can reload saved tasks later. If the file is missing or no task is selected, warning messages are displayed.

The layout features a scrollable task list for easy navigation. This basic task manager is a good example of using Python to build a functional, lightweight GUI application, demonstrating file persistence and user interaction.
